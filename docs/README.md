# 7.0

Getting evasi0n7 (for jailbreaking iOS 7.0.x) to play nicely!

Please go to the repository [here](https://github.com/UInt2048/7.0) for the patched apps,
which you will find in the `execs` folder.

---

The macOS applications provided don't work on macOS 10.15+, just like the original, due to lack of 64-bit support, and there isn't anything I can do about that.

There are six executables provided. `.app` executables are for macOS, and `.exe` are for Windows.

*  `evasi0n7-14` are the original unpatched files.
*  `evasi0n7-16` are the patched files, re-patched to this repository.
*  `evasi0n7-20` are patched files, requiring a local server set up.
